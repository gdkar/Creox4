Creox is a real-time sound processor. You can plug your electric guitar or any
other musical instrument directly to the PC's sound card and start
experimenting with various sound effects. Creox has a nice user-friendly GUI, a
preset support, a low-latency DSP engine and each effect parameter can be
altered "on the fly".

It requires JACK sound server (http://jackit.sf.net/).

As the creox is a JACK application, the output sound can be routed to the other
JACK-aware applications and the input audio can be taken as the output
from the other JACK client.
