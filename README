creox - 0.2.2rc2 - The realtime sound effector.
(c)2003 GPL-v2 Jozef Kosoru<jozef.kosoru@pobox.sk>

Creox is a real-time sound processor. You can plug your electric guitar or any
other musical instrument directly to the PC's sound card and start
experimenting with various sound effects. Creox has a nice user-friendly GUI, a
preset support, a low-latency DSP engine and each effect parameter can be
altered "on the fly".

It requires JACK sound server (http://jackit.sf.net/).

As the creox is a JACK application, the output sound can be routed to the other
JACK-aware applications and the input audio can be taken as the output
from the other JACK client. 
 
The simplest way to compile this application is:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

And to run it:
creox/creox

Please report all bugs to <laudrup@stacktrace.dk>.
